## Builder preview & network troubleshooting checklist

Follow this checklist to make sure Builder can load your models without network interference:

1. Temporarily disable any VPN, corporate proxy, or traffic-filtering browser extensions.
2. At the operating system, antivirus, and DNS/firewall layers, allow outbound access to the following wildcard domains:
   - `*.builder.io`
   - `*.builder.my`
   - `*.builder.codes`
3. Re-enable security tooling once the allow-lists are in place.

### Configure the Builder model preview

- Set the **Preview URL** in the Builder model documentation to your site domain:
  - Development: `http://localhost:5173`
  - Production (deployed): use the full `https://` URL of your live site.
- Update the preview instructions to read: `Open in new tab (use site domain)` so editors always launch the Builder preview using your own origin.

### Browser cache reset

- In the browser devtools, open **Application â†’ Clear storage** and click **Clear site data** for your domain.
- Retry loading the Builder preview in an **incognito/private window** to rule out cached credentials or extensions.

### Current status

- The application loads without runtime errors on our side; observed blocking happens before Builder loads, indicating a network or proxy filtering issue.
